<div class="align-content-center" style="width:50vw; margin: auto;">
    
    <p style="margin-top:5vh;"> TimeServed is, at its core, a way for public defenders to easily book appointments with clients and keep track of their appointment hours using the following process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An attorney can register an account on the platform</li>
        <li>From there, an attorney can book an appointment with a client</li>
        <li>A guard at the physical site will see all upcoming appointments, and bring the client into holding on the specified time</li>
        <li>Attorney arrives for meeting and clicks check-in for that appointment</li>
        <li>When the meeting is finished, the attorney then clicks check-out, and the time the meeting took is recorded</li>
    </ul>
